# 🩺 MediPilot: GenAI Care Navigator

**"Care doesn't stop at the prescription."**

MediPilot is an intelligent health companion designed to bridge the gap between receiving a medical report and actually following the care plan. It transforms complex, static medical documents into dynamic, actionable daily schedules.

## 🚀 The Problem
Patients often struggle to interpret lab reports or remember complex medication schedules. **Pre-adherence failure** occurs when patients don't fully understand *what* to do or *why* they are doing it before they even get home.

## 💡 The Solution
MediPilot uses advanced Multimodal AI to "read" your medical documents and generate a personalized health dashboard.
1.  **Upload & Decode**: Simply take a photo of a prescription or upload a PDF lab report.
2.  **Instant Care Plan**: The AI extracts medications, dosages, and critical findings.
3.  **Visual Timeline**: See exactly *when* to take your meds in a clear, linear day-view.
4.  **Adherence Simulation**: Tracks daily progress and generates "Doctor Summaries" for your next visit.
